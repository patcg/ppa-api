_A [Deliverable](https://www.w3.org/2024/11/wg-pat-charter.html#private-attribution) of the [Private Advertising Technology Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pat/) of [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)._

The specification contains all of the details. There is no [explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/). All the explanation can be found up front, before it gets into the gory details.
